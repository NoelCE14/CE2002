## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `database`: the folder to maintain databases stored as txt files
- `invoice` : the folder to maintain invoices generated as txt files
- `Visual Paradigm` : the folder containing the class and sequence diagram
- `src/html` : the folder containing all the javadoc
- `diagrams` : the folder containing png of required class and sequence diagrams
